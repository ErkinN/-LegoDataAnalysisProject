In this project i try to solve the challenge by DataCamp Project ---Exploring the evolution of LEGO

We have two main questions to answer:
1-QUESTION: What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star War themed ? Save your answer as a variable the_force in the form of integer
and we got answer 51 in line 33.

2-QUESTION: In which year was Star Wars not the most popular licensed theme (in terms of number of sets released that year)? save your answer as a variable new_era in the form of integer. 
and we got the answer 2017 in line 47
